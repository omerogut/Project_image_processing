# Project_image_processing
SUMMARY
In this project, I wanted to make filters on the face. At the moment, it is in a way to change lip color and add pig nose. For the lip color change, we adjust the shades of three different colors (blue, red, green) and see the color on the lips. In the pig nose addition part, it adds the image in png format to the nose part of the face.

LITERATURE REVİEW
Image processing projects have gained widespread popularity in various application domains with the rapid development of technologies in computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this section, we focus on critical topics that form the foundation of our project and summarize important studies in the literature.

1) Face Detection
Face detection refers to the ability to detect faces in an image. Algorithms such as ViolaJones, YOLO, and Faster R-CNN are widely used face detection methods in the literature. The Viola-Jones algorithm is known for its feature-based approach, providing high speed and low error rates. YOLO is a deep learning-based method designed to detect objects in a single stage. The advantages and limitations of these algorithms have been extensively examined in the literature within the field of face detection.

2) Facial Landmark Detection
Facial landmark detection involves finding the positions of specific points on a face. The shape predictor provided by the Dlib library is a commonly used method in the literature. This method focuses on detecting 68 different facial landmarks in an image. Facial landmark detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as face recognition, emotion analysis, and facial biometric systems.

3) Color Change and Filtering
Color change and filtering in images are commonly used techniques for adding aesthetic adjustments and creative effects. In this context, traditional image processing techniques such as Gaussian blur, color segmentation, and color filtering have been employed in our project. These techniques form the basis for the lip color change process in our project.

4) Image Processing Applications
Interactive image processing applications that work with users offer interactive and enjoyable experiences. Many examples of interactive interfaces and image processing applications can be found in the literature related to similar projects. Such applications enable users to be creative by applying various effects to images.

5) Deep Learning Applications
Deep learning models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), play a significant role in image processing projects. GANs are successfully utilized for realistic image generation and aesthetic adjustments. Literature on GAN-based image editing and effect application supports the deep learning aspect of our project.

HOW IT SEEMS?
When we first start the project, it asks us which option we want.

If we choose 1, it opens the Lips color and we can see in the next picture how it seems.

If we change the colors degrees, lips color change with them.

If we choose the second option, pig nose, we will see the next picture

If we choose the third option, devil horns, we will see the next picture.

If we choose the fourth option, mustache, we will see the next picture.
